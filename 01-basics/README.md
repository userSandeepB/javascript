# JavaScript Basics

Variables and Data Types are two most fundamental concept of any programming language we use variables as a symbolic names for values in our application. The names of variables, are called identifiers. In this section we will learn how to declare variables in JavaScript and what type of data JavaScript variable can hold.

> :point_right: We will start with ES5 syntax and gradually we will move to latest ES6 syntax later.

### Variable Declaration and Assignment using var

```javascript
// variable declaration
var firstName;

// variable assignment
firstName = "Mike";

// variable declaration and assignment
var age = 7;
```

### Data Types

The latest ECMAScript standard defines eight data types:

1. Seven data types that are primitives:

   - Boolean. true and false.
   - null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because JavaScript is case-sensitive, null is not the same as Null, NULL, or any other variant.
   - undefined. A top-level property whose value is not defined.
   - Number. An integer or floating point number. For example: 42 or 3.14159.
   - BigInt. An integer with arbitrary precision. For example: 9007199254740992n.
   - String. A sequence of characters that represent a text value. For example: "Howdy"
   - Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances are unique and immutable.

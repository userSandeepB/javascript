# Fundamental of Variables and Data Types

Variables and Data Types are the fundamental concept of JavaScript.

## Variables

Variables are a fundamental concept of every programming langauge. Variable is like a container in which we can store a value in order to use it over and over again in our code.

- Variable name cannot start with numbers or symbols except (\$ and \_).
- We cannot use JavaScript reserved keyword as variable name for example: function, if, for.

## Data Types

- Primitive Data Types

  - **Numbers**: Floating point numbers, for decimals and integers
  - **String**: Sequence of characters, used for text
  - **Boolean**: Logical data type that can only be true or false
  - **Undefined**: Data type of a variable that does not have a value yet
  - **Null**: Also means 'non-existent'

- Reference Data Types

  - **Object**

> **JavaScript has dynamic typing**: data types are automatically assigned to variables.
